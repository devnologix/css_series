    Flexbox, also known as the Flexible Box Layout module, is a powerful CSS layout system that 
    allows you to create flexible and responsive designs. It provides a straightforward way to 
    align and distribute space among elements in a container, regardless of their size or order.

    To use flexbox, you start by creating a flex container using the display property set to flex 
    or inline-flex. This container becomes a flex formatting context, which means it controls the 
    layout of its child elements.

    Imagine you have a row of boxes on a table, and you want to arrange them in a flexible way. 
    Flexbox is like a set of rules that you can apply to those boxes to organize them neatly.

    #Flex Container Properties:

    1. display: Specifies whether an element should be treated as a flex container. 
    The value can be flex, which establishes a block-level flex container, or inline-flex, 
    which establishes an inline-level flex container.

    2. flex-direction: Defines the direction of the main axis along which flex items are placed. 
    The main axis determines the direction in which flex items flow. The possible values are:

    3. row (default): Flex items are placed in a row from left to right.

    4. row-reverse: Flex items are placed in a row from right to left.

    5. column: Flex items are placed in a column from top to bottom.

    6. column-reverse: Flex items are placed in a column from bottom to top.

    7. flex-wrap: Specifies whether flex items should wrap to multiple lines if there is insufficient 
    space on a single line. The possible values are:

    8. nowrap (default): Flex items are all placed on a single line.

    9. wrap: Flex items wrap onto multiple lines if necessary.

    10. wrap-reverse: Flex items wrap onto multiple lines in reverse order.

    11. flex-flow: A shorthand property that combines flex-direction and flex-wrap in a single declaration. 
    For example, flex-flow: row wrap sets the direction to row and allows wrapping.

    12. justify-content: Aligns flex items along the main axis and controls the spacing between them. The possible values are:

    13. flex-start (default): Flex items are aligned at the start of the container.

    14. flex-end: Flex items are aligned at the end of the container.\

    15. center: Flex items are centered within the container.

    16. space-between: Flex items are evenly distributed along the main axis with space between them.

    17. space-around: Flex items are evenly distributed along the main axis with space around them.

    18. space-evenly: Flex items are evenly distributed along the main axis with equal space around them.

    19. align-items: Aligns flex items along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis) and 
    controls their vertical alignment. The possible values are:

    20. stretch (default): Flex items are stretched to fill the container vertically.

    21. flex-start: Flex items are aligned at the start of the cross axis.

    22. flex-end: Flex items are aligned at the end of the cross axis.

    23. center: Flex items are centered vertically within the container.

    24. baseline: Flex items are aligned based on their baselines.

    25. align-content: Defines how multiple lines of flex items are aligned along the cross axis when 
    there is extra space available. This property applies when there are multiple lines of flex 
    items due to wrapping. The possible values are the same as justify-content.

    #Flex Item Properties:

    1. flex-grow: Specifies how flex items grow to occupy available space along the main axis. 
    A value of 0 (default) means the item does not grow. Positive values determine the ratio at 
    which items grow relative to others.

    2. flex-shrink: Determines how flex items shrink when there is not enough space along the main axis.
     A value of 1 (default) means the item can shrink. Positive values determine the ratio at which 
     items shrink relative to others.

    3. flex-basis: Sets the initial size of a flex item along the main axis before it starts to grow or 
    shrink. The value can be a length (e.g., 20%, 200px) or auto (which sizes the item based on 
    its content).

    4. flex: A shorthand property that combines flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis into a single 
    declaration. The default value is 0 1 auto.

    5. align-self: Overrides the align-items value for a specific flex item, allowing individual control 
    over its alignment along the cross axis.

    These properties give you fine-grained control over the layout and behavior of flex items within 
    a flex container. By utilizing different combinations of these properties, you can create dynamic 
    and responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and content structures.


    By applying these flexbox rules to the boxes, you can create different layouts and adjust them 
    based on the available space. It's like having a flexible grid system that adapts to different 
    screen sizes and content.

    Flexbox makes it easier to create responsive designs where the boxes automatically adjust and 
    reposition themselves as needed. It simplifies the task of arranging elements on a web page, 
    making it more intuitive and flexible.
