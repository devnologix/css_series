    CSS Grid is a powerful layout system in web development that allows you to create complex,
    grid-based layouts for your website or web application. It provides a way to divide a webpage
    into rows and columns, and then position and arrange elements within those rows and columns.

    All the properties of a CSS Grid container.

    1. display: grid;: This property is used to enable the CSS Grid layout on a container element. It
    tells the browser that you want to create a grid and position its children elements accordingly.

    .container {
    display: grid;
    }

    2. grid-template-columns: Defines the size and structure of the grid's columns.

    .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr 2fr;
    }

    In this example, the grid will have three columns, where the first column is 100 pixels wide,
    and the remaining space is divided into two parts: one part taking up one fraction and the other
    part taking up two fractions.

    3. grid-template-rows: Defines the size and structure of the grid's rows.

    .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 50px 200px;
    }

    In this example, the grid will have two rows, where the first row is 50 pixels high and the
    second row is 200 pixels high.

    4. grid-template-areas: Provides a way to visually define the layout of the grid using named
    grid areas.

    .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar main"
    "footer footer";
    }

    In this example, the grid will have three rows and two columns, and the cells are named as "header,"
    "sidebar," "main," and "footer". This allows you to position items within those areas using the
    grid-area property on the grid items.

    5. grid-gap (or gap): Sets the spacing between grid cells, both horizontally and vertically.

    .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-gap: 10px;
    }
    In this example, there will be a 10-pixel gap between grid cells, providing spacing and margins
    between the grid items.

    6. justify-items: Controls how the grid items are horizontally aligned within their respective cells.

    .container {
    display: grid;
    justify-items: center;
    }

    In this example, the grid items will be horizontally centered within their cells.


    7. align-items: Controls how the grid items are vertically aligned within their respective cells.

    .container {
    display: grid;
    align-items: end;
    }


    In this example, the grid items will be aligned to the bottom of their cells.

    8. justify-content: Aligns and positions the grid itself horizontally within its container.

    .container {
    display: grid;
    justify-content: center;
    }

    In this example, the grid will be horizontally centered within its container.

    9. align-content: Aligns and positions the grid itself vertically within its container.

    .container {
    display: grid;
    align-content: space-around;
    }


    In this example, the grid will be vertically distributed with equal space around each row.

    10. grid-auto-columns: Specifies the size of implicitly created columns.

    .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-auto-columns: 100px;
    }

    In this example, implicitly created columns (when items are placed outside the explicitly
    defined grid) will have a width of 100 pixels.


    11. grid-auto-rows: Specifies the size of implicitly created rows.

    .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-auto-rows: 50px;
    }

    In this example, implicitly created rows (when items are placed outside the explicitly
    defined grid) will have a height of 50 pixels.

    12. grid-auto-flow: Determines how the grid auto-placement algorithm works, allowing you to
    control the placement of items that do not explicitly fit within the defined grid.


    .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-auto-flow: dense;
    }

    In this example, items will be densely packed within the grid, even if it means leaving empty
    spaces in the grid.

    These properties collectively provide you with extensive control over the layout and
    structure of your CSS Grid container. You can define the size and structure of columns
    and rows, visually lay out the grid using named areas, control spacing and alignment of
    grid items, handle implicitly created rows and columns, and more.

    All the properties of a CSS Grid Item.

    1. grid-column-start and grid-column-end: Specifies the starting and ending positions of the
    item along the horizontal grid lines.


    .item {
    grid-column-start: 2;
    grid-column-end: 4;
    }

    In this example, the item starts at the second column line and ends at the fourth column line.


    2. grid-row-start and grid-row-end: Specifies the starting and ending positions of the item
    along the vertical grid lines.

    .item {
    grid-row-start: 1;
    grid-row-end: 3;
    }

    In this example, the item starts at the first row line and ends at the third row line.


    3. grid-column and grid-row: A shorthand property that combines grid-column-start and
    grid-column-end, and grid-row-start and grid-row-end respectively.

    .item {
    grid-column: 2 / 4;
    grid-row: 1 / 3;
    }

    This is equivalent to the previous examples. The item starts at the second column line and ends
    at the fourth column line, and starts at the first row line and ends at the third row line.

    4. grid-area: Specifies both the starting and ending positions of the item along both the horizontal
    and vertical grid lines in a single property.

    .item {
    grid-area: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4;
    }


    This is equivalent to the previous examples. The item starts at the first row line, second column
    line, and ends at the third row line, fourth column line.

    5. justify-self: Controls how the item is horizontally aligned within its grid cell.

    .item {
    justify-self: center;
    }

    In this example, the item will be horizontally centered within its grid cell.


    6. align-self: Controls how the item is vertically aligned within its grid cell.

    .item {
    align-self: end;
    }


    In this example, the item will be aligned to the bottom of its grid cell.


    In the Last

    These properties allow you to control the positioning and alignment of individual grid items
    within the grid. You can define their placement along the grid lines using grid-column-start,
    grid-column-end, grid-row-start, and grid-row-end, or use the shorthand versions grid-column,
    grid-row, and grid-area. Additionally, you can control their horizontal and vertical alignment
    within the grid cell using justify-self and align-self properties.
