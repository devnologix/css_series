    In CSS, the span tag is an inline element used to apply styles or provide additional formatting
    to a specific section of text within a larger block of content. It does not have any semantic
    meaning on its own but is commonly used as a generic wrapper for small portions of text.

    The span tag is often used in conjunction with CSS classes or inline styles to apply specific
    styling rules to the enclosed text. For example, you can set the font color, background color,
    font size, or add text decorations like underlines or italics to the content within the span
    tag.


    <p>This is a <span class="highlighted">highlighted</span> text.</p>


    In this example, the word "highlighted" within the span tag will have a yellow background 
    color and be displayed in bold. The rest of the text within the p paragraph element will 
    remain unaffected.

    By using the span tag along with CSS, you can target specific portions of text and apply 
    customized styles to enhance the presentation of your content.
