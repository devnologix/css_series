    CSS Syntax:

    #Selectors: Selectors target HTML elements to which you want to apply styles.
    They define the scope of your CSS rules. Here are some common selectors:

    1. Element Selector: Targets elements based on their tag name.

    For example, p selects all <p> elements.

        2. Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class attribute value.

        For example, .my-class selects all elements with class="my-class".

        3. ID Selector: Targets a single element with a specific ID attribute value.

        For example, #my-id selects the element with id="my-id".

        4. Attribute Selector: Targets elements based on their attribute values.

        For example, [type="text"] selects all elements with type="text".


        #Properties: Properties define the specific styles you want to apply to the selected
        elements. Each property controls a particular aspect of an element's appearance. Here
        are some common properties:

        1. color: Sets the text color.

        For example, color: red;.

        2. font-size: Sets the size of the font.

        For example, font-size: 16px;.

        3. background-color: Sets the background color.

        For example, background-color: yellow;.

        4. padding: Sets the space between the element's content and its border.

        For example, padding: 10px;.

        5. margin: Sets the space around the element, outside its border.

        For example, margin: 20px;.

        6. border: Sets the border properties.

        For example, border: 1px solid black;


        Values: Values are assigned to properties to specify how the styles should be applied.
        Values can be numerical values, colors, keywords, or other specific values depending
        on the property. Here are some examples:

        1. Numerical Value: font-size: 20px; sets the font size to 20 pixels.
        2. Color Value: color: blue; sets the text color to blue.
        3. Keyword Value: text-align: center; aligns the text in the center.
        4. Length Value: padding: 10px; sets the padding to 10 pixels.
        5. URL Value: background-image: url("image.jpg"); sets the background image.


        CSS rules are written inside a set of curly braces {} and can be placed in a separate
        CSS file or within the style tags in an HTML document.
