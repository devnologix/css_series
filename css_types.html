    There are three main types of CSS:

    Inline CSS: Inline CSS is applied directly to individual HTML elements using the "style"
    attribute. It involves adding the CSS properties and values directly within the HTML tags.
    Inline CSS takes the highest priority and overrides any external or internal styles
    applied to the element. Here's an example:

    <br>

    <p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is a paragraph with inline CSS.</p>


    <br>


    Internal CSS: Internal CSS is defined within the style tags in the head section of an HTML
    document. It allows you to define CSS rules that apply to multiple elements on the same page.
    Internal CSS takes priority over external stylesheets but is overridden by inline styles.
    Here's an example:

    <p>This is a paragraph with internal CSS.</p>

    External CSS: External CSS is stored in separate CSS files and linked to HTML documents
    using the link tag. This method allows you to maintain a consistent style across multiple
    web pages. External CSS files have the lowest priority and are overridden by inline and
    internal styles. Here's an example:

    <p>This is a paragraph with external CSS.</p>


    External CSS provides the most flexibility, as you can create and link multiple CSS files
    to different web pages, ensuring consistent styles throughout your website.
